A hands-on tutorial for learning LiDAR odometry implementation from the ground up using Python.

## 📚 Complete Tutorial Guide

This repository includes a comprehensive PDF guide that explains the implementation details:
- **📖 [Lidar_odometry_for_beginner.pdf](Lidar_odometry_for_beginner.pdf)** - Read this alongside the code for complete understanding

The PDF covers mathematical foundations (not deeply), algorithm explanations, and implementation strategies that complement the practical code examples in this repository.

## Overview

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to implementing LiDAR odometry, bridging the gap between complex mathematical theory and practical, working code. The tutorial is designed for those who understand the basic concepts but struggle with actual implementation.

### Why This Tutorial?

- **Theory-to-Practice Gap**: Many resources explain *what* needs to be done, but few show *how* to implement it line by line
- **Language Accessibility**: Uses Python instead of C++ to focus on core principles without language barriers
- **Progressive Learning**: Each chapter builds upon the previous one, from basic visualization to complete odometry systems
- **Real Data**: Works with actual KITTI dataset sequences for realistic learning

### Important Note

This Python implementation prioritizes understanding over performance. For real-time applications, consider the advanced C++ version after mastering the concepts here:
